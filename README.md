# PROJECT LANDING PAGE

# Introduction

For this project you’ll be creating an entire web page from a design we’ll
provide for you. If you’ve been following along you should have the skills you
need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!<br>
<br>
The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image
of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and
colors we’ve used.<br>
<br>
Do _not_ be afraid to use google or go back to previous lessons to look
something up. **Real-life, professional developers use google** _constantly_
**for things that they have been doing for years.** At this point it is not expected
that you will have everything memorized, so don’t worry about it.
Additionally, there are a few small details that you may not have encountered
in our lessons yet. _This is by design._ These details are minor, and easily
searched (e.g. google css rounded corners).<br>
<br>
Get your project as close as you can to the design, but do not worry about getting
it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins
between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something
from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position
relative to the rest. It doesn’t matter if you use
<span style="color:red">margin: 24px</span> when the design actually
has <span style="color:red">margin: 48px.</span><br>
<br>
_Finally_, feel free to substitute your own content into this design. The images
have some meaningless dummy content, but if you want to make up a business and
personalize this page, please feel free to do so! Insert actual images in the
placeholders, and feel free to play with the colors and fonts a bit too.<br>

> ## A note about images on the web <br>
>
> You do not have the legal right to use just any image that you find on the web.
> There are many free images to be found, but make sure that the image you use is
> actually free for you to use, and make sure to credit the creator of the image
> in your project. An easy way to give credit is to put the creator’s name and
> contact info in a README file in your repository. Some good places to find
> free-to-use images on the web include Pexels, Pixabay, and Unsplash.
